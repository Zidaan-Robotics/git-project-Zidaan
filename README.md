# git-project-Zidaan

(GP 2.1)
wassup guys
Files java class is used
Makes a method:
    first, we create a git folder
    then we create an objects folder
    then we create an index file inside the git folder
    then we create a HEAD file inside the git folder

Makes another method:
    deletes the 4 aforementioned files/directories

Both methods are tested in a new Tester.java file

(GP 2.2)
Added a sha1 hash method, which takes in a file and returns the sha1 hash of its contents.
I added a testfile.txt to test this with.
